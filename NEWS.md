# RImagePalette 0.1.1

- Very important bug fix where when creating discrete scales for use with `ggplot2` the plot colors and the legend colors did not match.
This impacts:

    + `scale_color_image`
    + `scale_fill_image`


- Added `quantize_image` function

    + Allows user to reduce the number of distinct colors in given image


# RImagePalette 0.1.0

* First release!
